ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ for foreign visiters:

my name is mariana cÃ©zar and i'm a 17 year old begginer developer from blumenau, a city in brazil. 

i'm currently finishing high school, while also participating on a program called "jovem programador", or young coder, in a very rough translation (it definitely sounds better in portuguese); and i'm also going to tecnincal school to become technician at cybersistems for automation.

my programming languages, this far, are:
- C
