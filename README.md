### ** tap tap the mic ** testing, 123.. GET TO KNOW ME!

hello world!
i'm a eighteen year old programming student, to say the least. 
my interests go way above programming, but tech as a whole. literally can't see a piece of tech without wondering everything about it's creation. HOW WAS IT MADE? WHO MADE IT? WHAT PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE? WHAT DATABASE?

and that makes me a learning enthusiast and a eternal student of life..

this git it's just a dump of everything i touch and create and study, so there's too much to explain about this mess of a git...
i'll just leave you to see and try to understand it. :)

see ya
